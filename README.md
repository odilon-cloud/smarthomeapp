# Smart Sensor App

## Overview
The **Smart Sensor App** is a cross-platform mobile application developed using Flutter. This app leverages the power of Flutter packages to create a versatile and intuitive user experience, compatible with both Android and iOS devices. The application provides real-time insights into sensor data, supports location-based notifications, and includes several practical utilities tailored for outdoor activities.

## Features
- **Real-Time Sensor Activity Visualization:**
  - Implemented dynamic mobile graphs that display sensor activities in real-time, providing users with clear and intuitive insights into sensor data.
  
- **Geofencing for Hunting Areas:**
  - Added geofencing capabilities that allow users to define specific areas, such as hunting zones. The app provides alerts and notifications when entering or leaving these zones, enhancing safety and awareness.

- **Integrated Compass and Torch:**
  - The app includes a built-in compass and torch, making it a useful tool for navigation and visibility during outdoor activities.
  
- **Brightness Regulation:**
  - The application automatically adjusts its brightness based on environmental lighting conditions, optimizing visibility and extending battery life.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/smart-sensor-app.git
      cd smart-sensor-app
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. **Run the app:**
   - For Android:
     ```bash
     flutter run
     ```
   - For iOS:
     ```bash
     flutter run
     ```

## Usage
- Launch the app on your mobile device.
- Use the **sensor activity graph** to monitor real-time data from connected sensors.
- Set up **geofences** by defining areas on the map, particularly useful for hunting zones, and receive notifications as you enter or leave these areas.
- Utilize the **compass** for direction and the **torch** for illumination, especially during night-time activities.
- Enjoy an optimized experience with automatic **brightness regulation** tailored to your surroundings.

## Future Enhancements
- Integration with additional sensor types for broader data monitoring.
- Customizable notification settings based on user preferences.
- Enhanced data analytics and reporting features for long-term sensor data.
